# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

NFT Sales Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord and twitter bot that tweets out sales of a inputted NFT collection using the contract address. Sales reported on Opensea will be tweeted and posted.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This software will include both a discord and twitter bot. The discord bot will post embeded messages containing info on a NFT sale for a specific collection
specified by the user. These sales will be scraped from the biggest NFT trading platform, Opensea. The twitter bot will utilize the Opensea api to tweet out
live sales that includes data such as seller, buyer, price, and timestamp. The discord bot will then scrape the twitter bot and post in the discord channel.
The code will ask the user for input on what NFT collection they want to monitor. The user can either input the opensea collection link or the eth collection
contract address to specific which collection they want. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A NFT sales bot that only posts on discord and twitter. The collection is preset to only one collection that will be hardcoded. Provides simple data such as buyer and seller info.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A NFT sales bot that posts on discord and twitter that supports multiple collections. The bot lets the user input the collection and can post multiple collections at the same time. Comoes with bueyr and seller info and price of sales and img of nft itself.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A NFT sales bot that posts on discord and twitter that supports multiple collections. The bot also scrapes transcation history to post how much the seller either profited or lost form their purchaase factoring in the eth price and eth amount on times of buying and selling that NFT.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I already know my way around Opensea, but I need to look into the Opensea API and learn how to use it. I also have to learn how to use Heroku and how to host the discord and bot 24/7. I have to apply for a twitter developer account so that I can get a twitter developer key. I will start with the twitter bot and work onto the discord bot. I have to learn how to scrape websites and how to manipulate data and do calculations to calculate profit and losses. I need to research about APIs, hosting, and data management.
